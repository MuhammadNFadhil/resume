            famous “Rubik’s Cube” puzzle in a minimum number of steps. It
            gives a list of the followed steps to solve the cube at any state,
            as well as a nice representation of the process with smooth
            animations.

            A C++ graphics library based on the standard old “graphics.h”
            header file. It adds two important functionalities though:

              An Object-Oriented API that allows dealing with each object as a
              separate entity. This allows object modifying in a much easier
              way.
            </li>
            <li>
              A simulation of a third dimension, the library simulates the
              existence of the Z-axis, and fakes depth rendering, this allows
              3D rendering which was not an available option in the standard
              graphics library.

          <h3>Infinity – a scripting language</h3>
          <p>
            An interpreted scripting language that is very similar to the
            pseudocode used usually to explain different algorithms. The main
            focus in this project was syntax simplicity and clarity. The main
            aim was to provide a way for understanding computer code for
            nonprogrammers and to create a more effective way of sharing
            source code between programmers using different programming
            languages and different syntaxes. So this syntax can be used as a
            unified language between programmers.

          <p>
            A basic two-dimensional game engine that can create simple
            in-engine 2d games. it provides a complete physics system, a well
            optimized 2d renderer, a sound system, controller support, and
            scripting support using the Infinity language mentioned above.

          <h3>Xwidgets</h3>
          <p>
            A Windows-Only C++ GUI library, which works as a wrapper to the
            standard Win32 API that Windows provides, which makes it easier to
            integrate it with native code to make hybrid apps with the power
            of Win32 and the simplicity of Xwidgets.

          <p>
            A high-speed peer-to-peer file transfer app that works on the
            level of the network. It uses IP addresses to identify users and
            it can deal with multiple files and multiple users at the same
            time.

          <h3>Siren – a password manage</h3>
          <p>
            Siren is a secure and safe password manager that can auto generate
            an infinite number of random and very strong passwords to be used
            for different social media accounts for example. You don’t have to
            memorize anything except the app password, everything else is
            stored in the app itself in an encrypted form. So basically, you
            memorize one password for all of your accounts, without having to
            set the same password for all of them.

          <h3>BLOX – a file vault</h3>
          <p>
            BLOX is a file vault that helps keeping your personal and work
            files safe, encrypted, and hidden, so that they cannot be reached
            at all, or even if reached, they are unusable unless you unlock
            them using your decryption key.

          <h3>Batch</h3>
          <p>
            Batch is an Adobe Photoshop plugin I created to help with batch
            rendering, which is, creating a large number of files based on the
            same template and filled with different data. For example, you can
            create personal cards of 1000 employees each with his/her unique
            name and info by on button click, all you need to do is to provide
            the plugin with a PSD template and an excel spreadsheet with the
            employees’ data.

          <p>
            Candy is responsive mobile-first front-end web framework, that is
            very similar to Bootstrap, with the difference of it focusing more
            on the grid system than on having a complete CSS style library. It
            also contains a style library though, which is optional to include.
            The visual style it adds, is where the framework’s name came from.

          <p>
            OOP- Based library that makes dealing with databases a lot easier.
            It deals with the different components of the database as objects
            that are self-contained. It is made in C++ to get the best
            performance possible, and to be able to be imported and used
            natively in other programming languages.
